   - Assignees (you or a teammate)
   - Milestone (e.g., `v1.0 Release`)

4. **Click the 'Projects' tab → New Project**
   - Choose a Kanban template or custom board
   - Add columns like `To Do`, `In Progress`, `Done`

5. **Add issues to the project board**
   - Drag issues across columns to simulate workflow progress
