# LAB06 - Exercise: Clone & Push

Follow these steps to complete the lab:

## Task 1: Setup a GitHub Repository
TODO: Sign in to your GitHub account (create one if you don't have it yet).
TODO: Create a new public repository named `git-remote-lab` via the GitHub web interface.
TODO: Note the repository URL that GitHub provides after creation.

## Task 2: Clone the Repository
TODO: Open your terminal/command prompt.
TODO: Navigate to your desired directory where you want to store the project.
TODO: Clone your newly created repository using `git clone` and the URL you noted.
TODO: Navigate into the cloned repository directory.

## Task 3: Create Local Content
TODO: Create a README.md file with a project title and brief description.
TODO: Create a Python file called `hello.py` with a simple "Hello, GitHub!" print statement.
TODO: Add and commit both files with an appropriate message.

## Task 4: Push to GitHub
TODO: Push your commits to the remote repository using `git push`.
TODO: Visit your GitHub repository in a web browser to verify your files appear online.
TODO: View the commit history on GitHub.

## Task 5: Modify Files and Push Again
TODO: Make a change to the README.md file by adding a new section about project features.
TODO: Modify `hello.py` to include a function that returns a greeting message.
TODO: Commit these changes with a descriptive message.
TODO: Push your new commits to GitHub.
TODO: Verify the changes appear in the GitHub repository.

## Task 6: Explore Remote Configuration
TODO: Use `git remote -v` to display the configured remote repositories.
TODO: Create a new file locally and commit it without pushing.
TODO: Use `git status` to verify your local repository is ahead of the remote.
TODO: Push the changes to synchronize the repositories.

## Task 7: Working with Multiple Remotes (Simulation)
TODO: Create a new directory to simulate a second remote.
TODO: Initialize a new Git repository in this directory.
TODO: Add your GitHub repository as a remote called `origin`.
TODO: Create a file called `contribution.txt` with some content.
TODO: Commit and push this file to your GitHub repository.
TODO: Return to your original repository and pull the new changes.

## Bonus Task
TODO: Research GitHub authentication options (Personal Access Token, SSH keys).
TODO: Document the steps to set up SSH authentication with GitHub in a file called `AUTHENTICATION.md`.
TODO: Configure your local repository to use SSH instead of HTTPS (if you're using HTTPS).
