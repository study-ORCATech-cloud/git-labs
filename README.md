# Git & GitHub Automation Labs

Welcome to the **Git & GitHub Automation Labs** — a hands-on learning series focused on mastering version control, team collaboration, and automation workflows using Git and GitHub.

These labs are part of the larger **DevOps training journey**, helping you develop foundational and advanced skills in managing source code, collaborating on projects, and automating workflows.

By completing these labs, you will:
- Understand Git basics: init, commit, branch, merge
- Work with remote repositories on GitHub
- Collaborate through pull requests and reviews
- Track and manage issues and project boards
