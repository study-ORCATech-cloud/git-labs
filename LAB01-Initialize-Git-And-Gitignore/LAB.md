Follow these steps to complete the lab:

## Task 1: Initialize a Git Repository
* Create a new directory called `my-first-repo` and initialize a Git repository inside it.

## Task 2: Examine the .git Directory
* List the contents of the .git directory and identify at least 3 important files/folders.

## Task 3: Create Project Files

* Create your first commit with an appropriate message.

## Task 6: Verify Your Setup
