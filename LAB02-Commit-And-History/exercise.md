# LAB02 - Exercise: Commit & History

Follow these steps to complete the lab:

## Task 1: Create Project & Initial Commit
TODO: Create a new directory called `git-history-lab`, initialize a Git repository, and create a Python file called `main.py` with a simple print statement.
TODO: Make your initial commit with an appropriate message.

## Task 2: Make Multiple Commits
TODO: Update `main.py` to include a function that returns a greeting message, then commit this change.
TODO: Add a new file `README.md` with a brief project description, and commit it.
TODO: Add a new function to `main.py` that calculates the sum of two numbers, and commit this change.

## Task 3: Explore Commit History
TODO: Use `git log` to view your commit history.
TODO: Try the `--oneline` flag with `git log` and note the difference.
TODO: Use `git log` with at least two additional flags to customize the output (explore options like `--graph`, `--decorate`, `--author`, `--since`, or `--until`).

## Task 4: Compare Versions
TODO: Use `git diff` to see the changes between your working directory and the last commit.
TODO: Create a new change in `main.py` but don't commit it yet.
TODO: Use `git diff` to see uncomitted changes.
TODO: Use `git diff` with commit hashes to compare your first and last commit.

## Task 5: View Specific Commits
TODO: Identify the hash of your second commit and use `git show` to view its changes.
TODO: Use a relative reference (like `HEAD~1`) with `git show` to view a specific commit.

## Task 6: Annotated History
TODO: Create a file called `HISTORY.md` where you list each commit you've made with its hash and a brief description.
TODO: Commit this file with a message explaining its purpose.

## Bonus Task
TODO: Use `git blame` on `main.py` to see who made each change (line by line).
TODO: Research and try `git shortlog` to get a summary of commits by author.
